# This is a heading

And I'lll type random things, maybe thrown in a little bit of maath on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$. 

And ofcourse there will be multiline mathh 
$$
\begin{align*}
a &= \int_{0}^{1} f(x) dx \\
 &= \textrm{potato}
\end{align*}
$$
We can then go to the next section

### Bullet points

So we can start counting

- asad
- farwa
- asad $cat$
- Faewa `cat`

![test-pic](./test-pic.svg)

We can then also add tables

| Name        | Symbol | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Potato      | $P$    | It is a potato                                               |
| Point       | $x$    | A coordinate description of a point given by $x$             |
| not a point | $l$    | This is not a point. But this has quite the long description, it might not even fit, but I think pandoc handles it fine, no issues. `pandoc` has a good system for making sure the column sizes make sense and we just use python's `subprocess` module to get pandoc to work. |
