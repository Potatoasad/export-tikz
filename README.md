# typora2tex
Quick terminal application that takes my typora notes and converts them into tex. 
The idea is something like this:

You should be able to convert it to a tex file (with the same name)
```bash
typora2tex mymarkdown.md
```

You should be able to give your own preamble if needed
```bash
typora2tex mymarkdown.md --preamble=mypreamble.tex
```
